# Sonar-Classification-using-Logistic-Regression-
Project Description: Implemented logistic regression to classify sonar signals as either rocks or mines based on their features. The dataset was preprocessed, split into training and testing sets, and then used to train the logistic regression model. Achieved an accuracy of 83% on the training data and 76% on the testing data.

Key Responsibilities and Achievements:

Imported and preprocessed the dataset using pandas and numpy.
Split the data into training and testing sets using scikit-learn's train_test_split function.
Trained a logistic regression model using scikit-learn's LogisticRegression class.
Evaluated the model's performance on both training and testing data using accuracy_score metric.
Utilized the trained model to classify new sonar signals, achieving 76% accuracy on unseen data.
